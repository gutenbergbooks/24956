<h3>ANNIE&rsquo;S PLAN.</h3>


<p>Annie Lee was a cripple. Until her
eighth summer she had been strong
and well, like most other children;
but then disease began to appear,
and although she had skilful doctors
and kind nurses, it was soon too
plain that she was never to be well again.</p>

<p>Five years of pain and weakness had been her
portion at the time our story commences. So
accustomed had she become to her sad situation,
that it seemed like a delusive dream when she
remembered the sportive hours of her earlier
childhood. Like other sick children, she was
far more thoughtful than was quite natural at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg&nbsp;6]</a></span>
her age, and very seldom in her easiest moments
laughed aloud. But she was not an unhappy
child.</p>

<p>As soon as she was old enough to understand
that she had a sinful heart and needed salvation,
she had earnestly sought the Saviour of sinners,
and had been graciously received by him, and
made a lamb of his flock. In the school of Christ
she learned to bear pain without murmuring, and
to submit with cheerfulness to her lot in life.
Instead of requiring comfort from her parents,
who seemed to realize her misfortune more fully
than she did herself, she became their consoler,
and rarely failed in her efforts to lighten their
sorrow on her account.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It might have been so much worse, mamma,&rdquo;
she said one day, when Mrs. Lee was lamenting
her condition. &ldquo;Only think of poor lame Phelim,
Biddy Dillon&rsquo;s little boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter with him?&rdquo; asked her
mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you not seen him? He is often in the
back-yard when Biddy comes to wash in the
kitchen. I&rsquo;ve watched him often. I think it
was before he came to this country&mdash;but I&rsquo;m not
sure&mdash;that a large stone, falling from a wall, so
mangled his poor limbs that one of them had to
be cut off. I never see him limping about on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg&nbsp;7]</a></span>
his crutches while Biddy is washing without
thanking God for my happier fate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Annie, it is not probable that he suffers
one-half as much as you do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As much <em>pain</em>, do you mean, mamma?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of that. They are very
poor; and if he lives to be a man, how can he
earn the comforts of life? I need have no care
on that account.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I daresay he has none. There are several
trades that he might learn which require a sitting
posture; he might be a shoemaker, for instance.
Do not fret on his account, Annie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to me, mamma,&rdquo; replied Annie,
with a thoughtful air, &ldquo;that his only prospect
for the future is to be pushed about here and
there in the crowd, until at last he finds a refuge
in the grave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What foolish fancies!&rdquo; said Mrs. Lee, rising,
as a noise in the yard below attracted her to the
window. &ldquo;We know nothing about the future,
and it is not quite right to make ourselves sad
about it. It is hardly like your usual trust in
God, to be thus imagining trouble. There&rsquo;s a
little lame boy in the yard, who, I suppose, is
Phelim; he seems happy enough. Hark! don&rsquo;t
you hear him sing? He is sitting on the bench
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg&nbsp;8]</a></span>
behind the clothes-frame, and his mother is
hanging out the clothes to dry. Don&rsquo;t you hear
her laugh at what he is singing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, mamma? Can you hear the
words?&rdquo; asked Annie, brightening up, and raising
herself on her elbow as she lay on her low
couch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear them very well; but his Irish gibberish
is as Greek to me. All that I can make out
is what seems to be the chorus:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;O Ireland, green Ireland,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Swate gem o&rsquo; the sae!&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; said Annie, after listening with
smiling interest a while, &ldquo;it troubles me very
often because Phelim knows nothing about our
Saviour. He has a sister, two years older than
I am, who cannot read. She never went to
school; and none of the family can read a word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you learn this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From Phelim. I speak to him sometimes
when he plays under the window.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know how we can help them.
If we should offer to teach them, they would not
be willing to learn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure of it, mamma?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not quite so sure, perhaps, as if I had tried
to instruct them; but I know that they regard a
book as a sort of Protestant trap, made on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg&nbsp;9]</a></span>
purpose to catch them, soul and body. It is an evil
that we cannot remedy.&mdash;Have you more pain
than usual, my dear?&rdquo; said Mrs. Lee, appearing
a little startled, and bending anxiously over
Annie&rsquo;s couch as she observed an unusual flush
on her pale cheek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, mamma; but I was thinking of a plan
that I have had for some weeks, and hoping that
you would not object to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Object! You shall have whatever you like,
if it can be procured. What is it, Annie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear mamma,&rdquo; said Annie, &ldquo;I do so long
to do some good! I cannot bear to live such a
useless life. Every day, when I feel the goodness
of God and his great love to me, I long to
do something for him. And I think, mamma,
that I have planned a way to do good without
getting off my sofa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are always doing good, Annie. Do you
suppose that your patience under suffering is
not a lesson to us in our smaller trials? There
are many ways in which you are a blessing
to us all; so do not weary yourself with new
schemes. If God had required active service
from you, he would have given you health and
strength.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I can do something, mamma. Please
to hear my plan. I want to tell you something
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg&nbsp;10]</a></span>
more about Phelim&rsquo;s sister. She has been Mrs.
Green&rsquo;s servant, and her business was to assist
in the nursery. She would have done nicely,
Phelim says, but for her violent temper. Last
week one of the children was cross and provoking,
and the girl got angry and pushed him down-stairs.
He was much bruised; and, of course,
she was dismissed at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should hope so. But your plan, Annie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The poor girl has no place, mamma, and,
with such a dreadful temper, is not likely to get
one soon. And they are very poor. I know
that since Jessie left us, you are too closely confined
here with me; and my plan is to have this
poor girl to wait on me, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Annie, what a wild project!&rdquo; interrupted
her mother. &ldquo;You must not think of it.
She would be throwing you out of the window,
or beating you to a jelly, in her first fit of ill-temper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, she won&rsquo;t, mamma,&rdquo; urged Annie.
&ldquo;She will not be so easily vexed here, and no
one is ever angry with me. Please to try her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you really in earnest, Annie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; and very anxious to be indulged in my
strange plan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you thought how awkward she will be
in assisting you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg&nbsp;11]</a></span>
&ldquo;I have thought of it all, over and over,&rdquo; replied
Annie, &ldquo;and I think she will make a good
nurse for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee hesitated a long time. She could
not bear to deny Annie, and could not overcome
her dislike to the proposed arrangement.
But Annie&rsquo;s pleading look at length decided
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wish very much to try this wild-goose
plan!&rdquo; she said, resuming the conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very much, mamma,&rdquo; replied Annie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you shall have your own way about it.
It will last but a few days, I am sure; and the
change will interest you at any rate, poor thing!&rdquo;
Then going to the window, she looked down into
the yard, and said, &ldquo;Mrs. Dillon, come up to
Miss Annie&rsquo;s room, will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a minute the woman made her appearance
at the door, with the suds still lingering in foamy
flakes upon her arms and along the folds of her
apron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have a daughter, I believe?&rdquo; said
Mrs. Lee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two of them, an&rsquo; ye plaze, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied
Biddy, wiping her arms as she spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are they both at home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Bessie that is in service; and it&rsquo;s only
Annorah that&rsquo;s at home, shure.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg&nbsp;12]</a></span>
&ldquo;What is Annorah doing?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. Lee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doing?&rdquo; repeated Biddy wonderingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean, how does she get her living?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At service too, ma&rsquo;am, when it is to be had.
But, shure, it&rsquo;s a bad timper she has, and will
sthrike and scold whin her blood is up. An&rsquo; she
has lost the fine, comfortable place she had with
Mrs. Green, jist for a thrifle of spaach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is unfortunate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, thin, ye may well say that. Anither
mouth in a family like me own is far from convenient
whin the cost of the mate and the flour
is beyond raach intirely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Biddy, Miss Annie wants some one to
wait on her in the place of Jessie, who has gone.
She has taken a fancy to try your girl. When
can she come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coom! Why, this very hour, an&rsquo; ye like.
A blessin&rsquo; on yer swate, pale face!&rdquo; said Biddy,
looking pityingly towards Annie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She must be gentler here,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lee;
&ldquo;she must govern her temper. Miss Annie must
not be excited and made worse by your girl&rsquo;s fits
of ill-humour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave her to me, mamma,&rdquo; said Annie. &ldquo;I
think, Mrs. Dillon, that there will be no trouble.
What did you say is her name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Annorah, an&rsquo; ye plaze, miss.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg&nbsp;13]</a></span>
&ldquo;Annorah? Very well. When shall she
come, mamma?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not until Monday, I think,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Lee.
Then turning to Mrs. Dillon, she added, &ldquo;You
may send her on Monday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; she gets a mad streak along o&rsquo; that pritty
crathur,&rdquo; said Mrs. Biddy, as she went down-stairs,
&ldquo;she desarves the warm bating she&rsquo;ll get
from her own mother at home.&rdquo;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>ANNORAH&rsquo;S FIRST APPEARANCE IN THE SICK-ROOM.</h3>


<p>Monday came, and Annorah came too. It was
with a doubting heart and a troubled look that
Mrs. Lee introduced her into her daughter&rsquo;s
chamber. It would be difficult to find a plainer-looking
or a more awkward girl.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee looked at the monstrous foot in its
heavy shoe, and at the thick, freckled hands,
that seemed incapable of the gentle services that
Annie&rsquo;s helplessness required, and wondered at
her own folly in indulging the singular caprice of
her daughter. But a single look at Annie assured
her that she, at least, felt no misgivings. Still,
she did not like to leave them by themselves
until she had tested the new attendant&rsquo;s ability.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span>
&ldquo;Annorah,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what sort of work can
you do? I&rsquo;m afraid you are not used to such
services as Miss Annie will require.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can do most anything, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; answered
the girl resolutely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed! Well, let me see how you would
manage to place Annie on the bed when she is
tired of the sofa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words were scarcely out of her mouth
before Annorah had lifted the frail form of the
invalid in her arms and deposited her in the
middle of the bed. Annie burst into such a
laugh as she had not indulged in for a year.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you may be satisfied, mamma,&rdquo; she
said; &ldquo;I never was moved easier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee began to think better of Annie&rsquo;s
plan, and joined quite cordially in her daughter&rsquo;s
mirth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if she were too tired to rest in any
position, what would you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Carry her to the windows, or out in the air,
for a change.&mdash;Will ye plaze to thry it, Miss
Annie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not now, Annorah.&rdquo; Then looking towards
her mother, she said, &ldquo;Mamma, you may be
easy; Annorah and I shall get on famously together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus assured, Mrs. Lee left them, and went
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg&nbsp;15]</a></span>
down-stairs with a better opinion of the rough
Irish girl than she had thought it possible to
entertain an hour previous.</p>

<p>Left by themselves, the two girls began to
form an acquaintance with each other. Two
persons more unlike could not have been brought
together. Annorah was evidently much interested
in her young charge, and felt the most
unbounded sympathy in her sufferings. Annie
spoke first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please draw my couch nearer the window,
Annorah. That will do. Now, sit down on this
low stool, and tell me how long it is since you
left Ireland.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s two years, miss, coom April.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So lately? Then you remember all about
the old country?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember! An&rsquo; it&rsquo;s me that&rsquo;ll niver forget
that same. The beautiful counthree it is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pleasanter than this, do you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A thousand times. There is no place in the
world like it; the dear ould counthree!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, then, did you leave it, Annorah?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bad luck we had, miss; and a worse luck
intirely here, the mane town that this is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me all about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What for? That ye, too, may laugh like
the rest, and call us the mane, dirty set of Irish
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg&nbsp;16]</a></span>
vagabonds?&rdquo; asked the girl, her small eyes kindling
with a sense of imaginary insult.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, Annorah. You don&rsquo;t think I would
say such things, do you? But you need not tell
me a word if you had rather not. I only thought
it would make me forget my pain for a little
time; and, besides, I love dearly to hear about
Ireland, or any place where I have never been,&rdquo;
said Annie, with a tone of voice so calm and
earnest that the girl could not doubt her sincerity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you, in truth? Why, thin, it&rsquo;s me
that&rsquo;ll talk till I hoarse meself dumb for yer
good. It was the famine, miss, that came first,
and stole the bit o&rsquo; food that was saved. The
praties were rotten in the field; and the poor
pigs starved that should have helped us out wi&rsquo;
the rint. Och, but it was a sore time o&rsquo; grief
whin sorra a mouthful were left for the bit
childer and the ould people who were weak
before wi&rsquo; ould age! In the worst time o&rsquo; all,
whin the need was the sorest, our Bessie got into
disgrace, and came home from service wi&rsquo; niver a
penny to help herself or us. There was nought
to do and nought to eat at all. The neighbours
were faint wi&rsquo; the hoonger; and so, before the
worst came, we left all that was dear and came
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg&nbsp;17]</a></span>
&ldquo;How many of you came, Annorah?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nine, miss, if we consider our uncles and
cousins. We did not come altogether; brother
John, who is dead, and uncle Mike, came first.
And a fine chance to work they got directly,
miss; and then they sent money to pay the old
folk&rsquo;s passage. Our hearts gathered coorage and
strength at once, miss, and we thought, shure,
the great throubles were over. But the next
vessel brought the bad news for us, and we
forgot the glimmer of hope we had; for it
was our own father dear who was dead o&rsquo; the
cholera.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Annorah!&rdquo; exclaimed Annie pityingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor indade! But soon came the money for
the rest; and much as we feared the deep wathers,
the hoonger still pressed on us, and the sickness
was every day striking down the stoutest, and so
we all left Ireland but Bessie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you like the passage across from Ireland?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you sea-sick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, miss. But we came in the steerage;
and a crowded, dirthy place it was. The dirt
was not so bad, for in the ould counthree it ofttimes
gets the betther o&rsquo; us; but the men were
either drunk or ill-nathured, and the women
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg&nbsp;18]</a></span>
quarrelled, and the young ones were aye cross or
sick; and a bad time they made of it all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you come directly here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; we stayed where we landed for seven
weeks, till we got word to our cousin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And since you have been here, Annorah,
what have you been doing? Have you been to
school?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; the praste forbade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor thing! Then you cannot read?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How should I know reading, I&rsquo;d like to
know? Who would teach me that same?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many good people would like to do it, if you
would like to learn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ower knowin&rsquo; for that, miss,&rdquo; replied
Annorah, with a glance which betrayed that she
was rather suspicious of Annie&rsquo;s good intentions.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mighty pity that readin&rsquo; was contrived at
all, for it&rsquo;s the books that makes the black heretics
o&rsquo; us. &lsquo;Let alone the books and the readin&rsquo;,&rsquo;
said Father M&lsquo;Clane to me last evening,
&lsquo;and confess to me faithfully all that ye hear in
the grand Protestant family, an&rsquo; all will go well
wi&rsquo; ye, Annorah,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;now and for evermore.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Annie laughed pleasantly. &ldquo;And so you are
to play the spy and the tattler; and however
kindly we may treat you, you are to report all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg&nbsp;19]</a></span>
our sayings and doings to the priest? I don&rsquo;t
believe, Annorah, that you can be mean enough
for that, if you try. I thought the Irish people
were too generous to act so low a part.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; so we are, shure. Sorra a bit will the
praste get from me about you here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he were a good man, a noble, honourable
man,&rdquo; said Annie, &ldquo;do you think he would ask
you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the praste!&rdquo; interrupted Annorah, her
eyes flashing; &ldquo;the praste, is Father M&lsquo;Clane.
An&rsquo; ye mind to spake well o&rsquo; him, it&rsquo;s nought
I&rsquo;ve to say; an&rsquo; the tongue is a heretic&rsquo;s that
would spake ill o&rsquo; him, and he laving the ould
counthree to stay for our good in this haythen
land. An&rsquo; the books an&rsquo; the readin&rsquo; were for the
like o&rsquo; us, would he not be the first to bid us
welcome to the same? Och, it&rsquo;s a good man and
a holy is Father M&lsquo;Clane, say what ye will, miss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not called him otherwise,&rdquo; said Annie,
much amused by the Irish girl&rsquo;s warmth. &ldquo;I
only asked you, or tried to ask you, if he would
be likely to require you to tattle and to be a tell-tale,
if he were so good as you describe him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It were jist putting before me eyes the
maneness of the man. Is that nothing at all,
and he a praste?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, Annorah, we will say no more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span>
about him now. I am tired, and must rest.
You won&rsquo;t mind being still a while?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor little thing!&rdquo; said Annorah; &ldquo;ye&rsquo;re
pale as a lily. Is there a dhrap o&rsquo; anything ye
would like, and then slape a bit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will try to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But ye cannot kape still. The pain is
shure too great. Let me carry you about a
little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no; it would tire you,&rdquo; said Annie,
who in her spasm of pain really longed for so
novel a method of changing her position.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least, let me thry it for once,&rdquo; urged the
girl, whose Irish sympathies were powerfully
awakened by her young mistress&rsquo;s evident suffering;
&ldquo;jist for once, darlin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Annie offered no further resistance, and, as
Annorah bore her light form carefully up and
down the room, experienced a feeling of relief
that inspired her with warm gratitude toward
her uncouth attendant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re light as down, honey,&rdquo; said Annorah,
as she met Annie&rsquo;s anxious, inquiring look.</p>

<p>Satisfied at last that she was really no heavy
burden, the weary invalid soon dropped asleep,
with her head on the Irish girl&rsquo;s shoulder. Mrs.
Lee opened the door and looked in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whist!&rdquo; said Annorah, in a low, impatient
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg&nbsp;21]</a></span>
whisper. &ldquo;Kape quiet, will ye, and let the poor
lamb slape!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee hardly knew whether to be amused
or provoked as she, the mistress of the house,
obeyed Annorah&rsquo;s imperative gesture, and withdrew
softly from the apartment.</p>

<h3>ANNORAH LEARNS TO READ.</h3>


<p>In a very few days Annie was intrusted to the
sole care of her young Irish nurse, who served
her with the most affectionate attention. Mrs.
Lee often came to sit with her suffering child,
but Annorah alone performed the tender offices
of the sick-room. Rough and uncouth as she
was, she readily adapted herself to the services
required; and no power on earth could have persuaded
her that Annie could be so well taken
care of by any one else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It naded a dale o&rsquo; contrivance, to be
shure,&rdquo; she said to her mother one afternoon,
when, Annie being asleep, she ran home
to ask after the family, &ldquo;or I would be well
bothered with all her pretty talk o&rsquo; books, and
taching me to read and write; but she, poor
darlin&rsquo;, shall say whatever she plazes to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg&nbsp;22]</a></span>
&ldquo;An&rsquo; if she spake ill o&rsquo; the praste and the
holy Church, how then, Annorah?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
Dillon, eying her daughter rather curiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blessed little good can <em>we</em> say o&rsquo; Father
M&lsquo;Clane, whin we spake truth, as ye know,
mother dear; and it&rsquo;s not to be expected o&rsquo; her
to tell lies for his sake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does she spake o&rsquo; the Catholic Church
Norah?&rdquo; asked her mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never at all, mother; so make yer heart
aisy. She spakes to me o&rsquo; meself, and the wickedness
in me heart; and when she leans so lovingly
on me shoulder, and raises her clear eyes to the
blue sky, or watches the bright sunset, and spakes
so softly to me o&rsquo; the beauty o&rsquo; a holy life, I feel
all the betther and patienter meself for hearing
the good words. She says, mother dear, as how
it is depravity that makes me so often angered
and wrong; and how that Jesus Christ, the Son
o&rsquo; God himself, died to save us and cure us o&rsquo;
our sin. It would do yer own heart good, could
ye hear her; and there&rsquo;s nought wrong in it at
all, ye see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Annie&rsquo;s influence grew stronger and stronger,
and not a day passed without some precious truth
from her lips finding a place in the heart of her
attendant. It was many weeks before Annorah
yielded to her persuasions, and commenced learning
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg&nbsp;23]</a></span>
to read. The pleasant summer days had
come, and they were often abroad in the fresh
air together, Annie in her low carriage, which
was easily drawn by her young nurse.</p>

<p>Down in the valley behind Mr. Lee&rsquo;s house
there was an old mill, long since deserted and
unused.</p>

<p>This was a favourite resort of Annie&rsquo;s, and it
was here that she taught Annorah to read, during
the long summer afternoons.</p>

<p>At first Annorah was listless, indifferent, and
often suspicious that all this attention to her
education boded no good to her old religious
prejudices. But she could deny Annie nothing;
and after a time, as her confidence in the piety
of her gentle teacher increased, she began to feel
a deep interest in the truths taught.</p>

<p>In her anxiety to please her invalid charge,
she made rapid progress in reading, and before
the end of the summer could write a few plain
sentences. She began to love knowledge for its
own sake; and many a pleasant hour did she
spend, when Annie was asleep or weary, in reading
the easy lessons selected for her. But she
was careful that neither her mother nor the priest
should suspect her progress in learning, and as
she still went regularly to &ldquo;confession,&rdquo; it was
easy to keep her secret from them. Annie was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg&nbsp;24]</a></span>
often not a little puzzled to know how she
managed to elude the vigilance of the priest.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful autumn afternoon, when the
air was just cool enough to be refreshing, that,
with Mrs. Lee&rsquo;s permission, Annie and her nurse
sought their favourite seat by the mill-stream.
Annie had been thinking more than usual about
Annorah&rsquo;s progress in religious knowledge, and
wondering how, with the light and wisdom she
had received, she could still cling to her old
superstitions. A great change had taken place
in her temper, which was now usually controlled;
her manners had gradually become more gentle;
but the radical change of heart that Annie so
longed to witness, did not yet show itself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me, Annorah,&rdquo; she said, after the usual
time had been spent in reading, &ldquo;does Father
M&lsquo;Clane know that you can read yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not he, indade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does he not question you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not exactly. He says I spake better English,
and that shure it is because I live where it is well
spoken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you say to that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said. &lsquo;True, your riverence.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that is hardly the truth, Annorah.
If anything has improved your language, it is
your reading.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span>
&ldquo;To be shure. But is it not because I am
with those who spake English well, that I&rsquo;m
learning to read? So it was the truth, after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not the whole truth, Annorah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then Annorah turned, and saw the shadow
of a man on the sloping rock at the left hand.
Her first impulse was to cry out, but the fear of
alarming Annie, and her own natural courage,
prevented her; and she soon thought she could
detect in the shadowy outline a resemblance to
Father M&lsquo;Clane. &ldquo;Och, then, the murder&rsquo;s out,&rdquo;
she thought; &ldquo;the mane creature has been listening,
and faith now he shall have a pill that will
settle his stomach intirely.&mdash;What were you
saying, Miss Annie?&rdquo; she asked aloud, turning
towards Annie&rsquo;s carriage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said that you did not tell him the whole
truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Small matter for that. It was all he asked
for, and it&rsquo;s better plazed he is than if it were
more. He&rsquo;s a lying ould thing himself, any
way!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Annorah?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye may well open yer eyes. Did he not
tell me last Sunday that you, miss, with your
sweet voice and comforting ways, were jist a
temptation placed in me way, by the ould inimy
himself?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg&nbsp;26]</a></span>
&ldquo;I, Annorah? What does he know of me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all, savin&rsquo; that ye are a saint,
and he an ould&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop, stop, Annorah. We must not speak
evil of any one. I hope that you were civil in
your reply.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Civil! indade I was. I said, &lsquo;Ye should
teach your flock better than to tempt honest
people.&rsquo; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; impudent ye are,&rsquo; says he;
&lsquo;ye&rsquo;ll be turnin&rsquo; heretic next. You must be
seen to and taken care of,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;Bad luck
to ye!&rsquo; says I; &lsquo;when ye sees me two eyes light
me to confession again, ye may take care o&rsquo; me
and welcome.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And shall you not go again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never again.&rdquo; Annorah saw the shadow
raise its hand threateningly. &ldquo;No, indade.
Where&rsquo;s the use o&rsquo; telling all ye know to an ould
creature like him? Doesn&rsquo;t the blessed Book
say that no man can come to the Father but only
through Jesus Christ? An&rsquo; shure, the great
Father in heaven is angered to see me kneel down
before that biggest o&rsquo; scamps, when I should be
praying to himself. I&rsquo;ll do it no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear you say so, Annorah; I
do so hope,&rdquo; said Annie, as the affectionate tears
stole down her thin cheek, &ldquo;that you are beginning
to learn in the school of Christ. But, my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg&nbsp;27]</a></span>
poor girl, you will meet much opposition. I am
afraid that your family will join with the priest
in opposing you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let them. I&rsquo;ll fight them all with pleasure&mdash;more
especially the praste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But fighting is not the way to make them
think well of the religion of Jesus. He was
mild and gentle, patient under abuse and persecution;
and he must be your pattern, if you
desire to please God. You must pray to him,
Annorah, for a new heart, so that none of these
angry feelings will trouble you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it the new heart, miss, that makes you so
sweet and patient?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I have any goodness, Annorah, it is because
God has changed my old heart, and made
it better. It is his grace that enables me to
suffer without complaining; and it is his love,
which I feel in my heart, that makes me calm
and happy in my greatest pain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I am sure,&rdquo; said the girl earnestly,
forgetting for a moment that she was overheard.
&ldquo;I will never rest a day at all, till I get that
same done for me. But mayhap he will not be
so willing to look upon me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In his holy Book we read that he is no
respecter of persons, and that whosoever cometh
unto him he will in no wise cast out.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg&nbsp;28]</a></span>
&ldquo;Why, then, I can coom as soon as the grandest.
<em>How</em> shall I coom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell you how I came to him. I studied
his holy Word to learn his will, and I prayed
often that he would give me his Spirit to teach
me the way to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; did he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. In a little time I began to know more
about myself, and to see how much I needed a
Saviour; and then I saw how willing Jesus must
be to save me, having died for me as well as for
others; and so, in a way that I can&rsquo;t explain, I
was led to give myself to him, and I soon found
peace in believing. He will teach you, Annorah,
and lead you right, if you earnestly seek him.
Look at the sunset clouds. Did you ever see
such gold, and crimson, and purple before? But
the sunset is not half so bright and beautiful as
the true Christian&rsquo;s prospects.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Looking at the sunset reminded Annorah that
it was late for her charge to be out. A very
slight rustle in the bushes behind her, recalled
what she had strangely forgotten, in her interest
in the conversation. She took up a large stone
and threw it among the bushes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is there, Annorah?&rdquo; asked Annie, in
alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only a sarpint, miss.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg&nbsp;29]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well, let us hasten home. Mamma will be
anxious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After they left, the dark form of a man rose
from behind the green knoll where they had been
sitting, and moved slowly along the bank of the
stream, down the valley. It was Father M&lsquo;Clane.</p>

<h3>THE PRIEST MEETS ANNORAH AT HER MOTHER&rsquo;S
COTTAGE.</h3>


<p>Biddy Dillon had just finished a large ironing
for one of the families in the village, and having
placed the clothes-frame where the dust from
the open fire-place could not fall on the fine
starched linens and muslins, she began to set
her table for tea, at the same time counting over
the gains of the week. Not a trifle in her
calculations were the wages of Annorah, who
came regularly every Saturday evening to add
her contribution to the family fund.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good child she is gettin&rsquo; to be, and a
pleasant-tempered one, too,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dillon to
herself; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s made over intirely, she is, our
Lady be praised!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She began to sing the burden of an Irish ditty,
but the broken-nosed tea-kettle over the fire
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg&nbsp;30]</a></span>
beginning to sing too, she commenced talking
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heaven send it mayn&rsquo;t be thrue, but it does
look like the heretic&rsquo;s doings. She were like a
brimstone match, or like gunpowder itself, at
home, and tender-hearted as a young baby besides.
Shure, it&rsquo;s a mighty power, any way,
that has so changed her. I can&rsquo;t jist feel aisy
about it, for it&rsquo;s Father M&lsquo;Clane will find out
the harm of her good spaches and doings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words were hardly out of her mouth when
the priest entered. The storm on his brow was
not unnoted by Biddy, but she respectfully set a
chair for him in the cleanest part of the room.
She was not quite so easily terrified by priestly
wrath and authority as she had been in her own
country; for she had the sense to know that the
ghostly father&rsquo;s malediction did not, as in Ireland,
entail a long course of temporal misfortunes
upon the poor victims of his displeasure.
But she had not yet acknowledged to herself the
doubts that really existed in her mind in regard
to the truth of the Romish faith; she still clung
to the errors in which she had been brought up,
and feared the effect on her eternal happiness of
Father M&lsquo;Clane&rsquo;s displeasure. So it was with a
beating heart that she awaited his time to address
her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg&nbsp;31]</a></span>
&ldquo;Do you know that your daughter is a heretic?&rdquo;
was his first question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indade, no, yer riverence,&rdquo; replied Biddy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; what sort o&rsquo; a mother are you, Biddy
Dillon, to stand still and look on while the wolf
stales the best o&rsquo; yer flock? You might have
known that heretic family would lave not a stone
unturned to catch her at last. And so she can
read&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Read!</em>&rdquo; interrupted the astonished woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, read! And it&rsquo;s the heretics&rsquo; Bible
she has read, too,&mdash;and all through your fault.
Mighty proud ye have been o&rsquo; all the fine housekeeping
ways she has learned, and very thankful,
no doubt, for the bits o&rsquo; could victuals from the
big house; but where&rsquo;s the good now? Ye may
thank yourself that she will lose her sowl for
ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Dillon started and turned pale as the
door softly opened, and Annorah herself, unobserved
by the priest, came in. He went on:
&ldquo;Do you call her better, the pestilent crather,
when, from her first going to the grand place on
the hill, never a word about them has been got
from her at confession? The obstinate crather!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came to your riverence for spiritual good,&rdquo;
said Annorah, now coming forward and laying
a fat chicken and sundry paper parcels beside
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg&nbsp;32]</a></span>
her week&rsquo;s wages on the little table by her
mother&rsquo;s side. &ldquo;I came for spiritual good, and
ye thried to teach me to tattle. It&rsquo;s a mane
trade intirely, lettin&rsquo; alone the maneness of sich
as teach it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Annorah!&rdquo; exclaimed her mother, &ldquo;do you
dare to spake in that way o&rsquo; the praste himself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean no harm, mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No harm!&rdquo; repeated Father M&lsquo;Clane, turning
fiercely toward her. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t cheat me
with words like these.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Annorah tossed her head scornfully and sat
down opposite the priest, who on his part seemed
far less desirous to carry on the war since her
arrival. The cottage that he occupied belonged
to Mr. Lee, and judging that gentleman by his
own heart, he feared that an unfavourable representation
of the case to him might either increase
his rent or turn him out altogether. Besides,
he was not unlike blusterers, and could denounce
the erring with greater ease when they stood
in awe of him. That Annorah felt neither fear
nor reverence for him, it was easy to see. So,
smothering his wrath, he began, to the great surprise
of Mrs. Dillon, to address the girl in his
most coaxing tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, come, Annorah,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let us be
friends. It&rsquo;s me that&rsquo;s ould enough, and willing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg&nbsp;33]</a></span>
too, to be to you in place o&rsquo; yer own father,
Heaven rest his sowl; but he&rsquo;s gone to a better
counthree than this sinful world. An&rsquo; yer own
good, child, is what I think on in spaking to
you of Miss Annie and the heretics generally.
It&rsquo;s not for meself, shure, that me prayers go up
at the could midnight hour whin ye&rsquo;re all sleeping
in quiet. It&rsquo;s not me own throubles that
make me dream o&rsquo; Heaven&rsquo;s wrath, but it&rsquo;s me
care for yer sowl, Annorah, and for the sake o&rsquo;
yer gettin&rsquo; saved at last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear that, Norah, child,&rdquo; said her mother.
&ldquo;Who else ever fretted themselves for yer good?
What would become o&rsquo; ye, an&rsquo; Father M&lsquo;Clane
gave ye up entirely?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your riverence must stay till I draw the tae
and fry a bit o&rsquo; the chicken,&rdquo; added Biddy, as
the priest rose to take his leave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;I must not sit
down at ease. Small rest is there for me when
the wolf is in the fold, and the flock is in danger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took leave quite cordially, but when he
was gone, Biddy turned, with a shadow on her
round face, to speak to her daughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s this ye&rsquo;ve been doing, child?
Is it me own ears that have heard o&rsquo; yer Bible-reading
and railing at the praste? What&rsquo;s coom
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg&nbsp;34]</a></span>
to ye now? Didn&rsquo;t I warn ye against their
heretic ways? An&rsquo; ye&rsquo;ve been and fallen into
the dape pit as aisy as a blind sheep. Och! for
shame, Annorah Dillon! Why do ye not spake?
What can ye say for yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said Annorah, &ldquo;how often you&rsquo;ve
said, when Larry O&rsquo;Neale&rsquo;s good luck has been
tould of, that it was the larnin&rsquo;, shure, that did
it all! An&rsquo; when we were over the great water,
you said, &lsquo;How nice and comfortable would it
be an&rsquo; we had one in the family like Larry himself,
to send back the news to ould friends, when
we got safe here.&rsquo; Do ye not mind, mother dear,
how often you&rsquo;ve said that same since? Well,
now, I&rsquo;ve been and learned what ye wanted so
much; and first cooms the praste and makes a
big fuss, and then you, mother, spake as if I had
thried to anger in the room o&rsquo; plasing ye. I&rsquo;m
sure I&rsquo;ve thried to plase you all I could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So ye have, mavourneen; so ye have,&rdquo; said
Biddy, her voice softening as she turned to look
at the chicken and other things that Annorah
had brought. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not yer mother, honey, that
has a word to say against you; but when Father
M&lsquo;Clane talks o&rsquo; yer being a heretic, it angers
me. This Bible that he frets about, what is it,
Norah?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s truth, mother, that he has given
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg&nbsp;35]</a></span>
to teach us all; and a brave book it is. Father
M&lsquo;Clane has one himself; and what frets him is,
that the heretics, as he calls them, can read it
for themselves and find out God&rsquo;s will; for only
the praste has it with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, an&rsquo; the praste tells us the same,
it saves us a world o&rsquo; bother, shure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if the praste is not a good man, he can
tell us whatever he likes; and how do we know
what is God&rsquo;s Word? Now, mother, in all God&rsquo;s
Word there is never a bit about confessing to a
praste, but a great deal about praying and confessing
to God himself. But, you see, if all our
people knew that same, sorra a bit o&rsquo; money
would go to the praste&rsquo;s pocket in comparison to
what he gets now. It&rsquo;s that, mother dear, that
makes him so afraid we shall learn. He can&rsquo;t
get the money from those who can read God&rsquo;s
Word for themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure it&rsquo;s all thrue?&rdquo; asked Biddy,
her eyes wide open with astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the truth of God. An&rsquo; it&rsquo;s this same
learning that&rsquo;s got out of the holy Book that
makes the difference between Protestants and
Catholics. They go to the Word itself, an&rsquo; we take
on hearsay whatever the praste tells us. An&rsquo;
there is no word in all the Book, mother, about
praying to Mary the mother of Jesus, or to any
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg&nbsp;36]</a></span>
of the saints. Everybody is invited to pray
straight up to God himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl&rsquo;s downright heresy, and her contempt
for the mummeries of the Romish communion,
troubled her mother. But what could she do?
The change for the better in the child&rsquo;s temper
had prepared her to look favourably upon the
change in her religion. She listened to Annorah&rsquo;s
continued account of what she had learned
from the Bible with the greatest interest, feeling
every moment more and more disposed to accept
its teaching, and less and less disposed to blindly
submit to the priest. Annorah stayed till a late
hour with her mother, repeating over and over
again the truths so interesting to herself, and
obtaining permission at last to bring the Bible
itself on her next visit. She was strictly cautioned,
however, to bring it privately, lest Father
M&lsquo;Clane should hear of it, and, in Biddy&rsquo;s language,
&ldquo;kick up a scrimmage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were more ideas in the old woman&rsquo;s
head than had ever found room there before,
when, after Annorah had gone, she sat down by
herself before the fire. She was both ambitious
and imaginative, and long vistas of future greatness
opened before her, all commencing with the
wonderful fact that <em>her</em> child could read and write.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; it&rsquo;s not all a queer drame,&rdquo; she said;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg&nbsp;37]</a></span>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hear her for meself coom next Saturday
Och! what a row it will make an&rsquo; Father
M&lsquo;Clane, and Teddy Muggins, and Mike Murphy
get wind o&rsquo; a heretic Bible being brought to the
place! But I&rsquo;ll hear and judge for meself, that
I will; an&rsquo; if the praste be right, small harm is
there to be shure; and if he be wrong, the
better for me poor sowl, and a saving o&rsquo; money.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>PHELIM BRINGS BAD TIDINGS TO ANNORAH.</h3>


<p>Annorah&rsquo;s troubles were not ended by the unexpected
encouragement received from her mother.
Her brothers and sister, and Irish acquaintance
generally, soon heard that she no longer went to
mass or to confession; and great was the uproar
among them. The unsparing rebukes of Father
M&lsquo;Clane, whenever he met with any one supposed
to have any influence over her, soon fanned
into life not only a vehement hatred of the Protestants,
but a bitter feeling of enmity toward
the poor girl herself. Those who had been most
cordial now either passed her in sullen silence, or
openly taunted her upon her defection; and the
very children in the lane hooted after her, when
she made her usual weekly visit to her mother.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg&nbsp;38]</a></span>
Annorah often found these things very hard
to bear. Her quick Irish blood was up with the
first insulting word; but she sought for strength
from above to control it, and no outbreak of passion
was suffered to mar the sweet lesson that
her patience and kindness toward all was insensibly
teaching.</p>

<p>She was getting ready for her usual Saturday
evening&rsquo;s visit to her mother&rsquo;s cottage, when her
attention was attracted by the low whistling of
a familiar Irish air in the yard below. Looking
out, she observed her lame brother, Phelim,
making signs for her to come out. A little
alarmed lest some evil had befallen her mother
she hurried out to meet him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Phelim? What is the matther,
dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Matther, do you ask? Well, the matther
is, that ye&rsquo;re not to coom home till ye&rsquo;re sent
for. Are ye not ashamed to make such a
row?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean. Sit down,
Phelim dear; you&rsquo;re over weak to keep standin&rsquo;
so. Does the new liniment no help ye at all?
And ye must carry home the money to mother,
and the tea, and the sugar, and some nice warm
woollen stockings that Mrs. Lee showed me how
to knit for yerself, darlin&rsquo;; and Heaven grant
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg&nbsp;39]</a></span>
that it&rsquo;s no a bad turn o&rsquo; pain ye will get in yer
bones by cooming to tell me. There&rsquo;s a cranberry-pie
that Mrs. Lee was to send for your
own self, Phelim dear; it will relish better than
our mother&rsquo;s plain cooking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The thought of eating the dainty so thoughtfully
provided, produced a choking sensation in
the boy&rsquo;s throat, as if it had there come into a
collision with his wrath against heretics. But
he said nothing, and Annorah went on:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been making some caps for mother; but
ye&rsquo;re no able to carry so many things at once,
poor fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still Phelim did not speak, but he gazed earnestly
into her face. The moon was up, and he
could plainly see the traces of tears on her cheek,
and the sad but loving expression of her eyes as
she returned his gaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; it&rsquo;s the Protestant religion that makes
you so good and kind, Norah,&rdquo; he said at length;
&ldquo;our Lady help me, and I could just be a heretic
wi&rsquo; ye!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s little I know yet o&rsquo; the truth, but, O
Phelim, it&rsquo;s a lovely way to heaven; and the
swate, blessed feeling that fills up the heart
when I pray straight up to the Lord Jesus
Christ himself, is better than to have all the
diamonds in a queen&rsquo;s crown. It makes me so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg&nbsp;40]</a></span>
light and happy; so contented intirely. It quiets
the bad temper into perfect peace; and I love,
as I never dreamed of doing before, all my friends
and enemies too. It&rsquo;s little I know yet, Phelim,
but all the gould in the world, and all the world&rsquo;s
hate too, shall not hinder me from learning more
o&rsquo; God&rsquo;s wonderful way to save sinners. But
hurry home now, Phelim, mavourneen; the raw
night air is no good for ye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They may say what they will, Norah,&rdquo; said
the boy, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m sure I will love ye for ever.
An&rsquo; ye&rsquo;ll tache me to get those heavenly feelings,
I&rsquo;ll jist follow the road ye have taken. I&rsquo;ve
plenty o&rsquo; time, as ye know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do ye mean, will I teach you to read?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll speak to Miss Annie about it. Hurry
home as fast as you can. Good-night, and God
bless you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With an affectionate kiss they parted; and
Annorah went slowly back to her young mistress&rsquo;s
room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is this, Annorah?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Lee, as
she entered. &ldquo;How happened you to return so
soon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not been home, an&rsquo; ye please, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you not going to-night?&rdquo; asked Annie,
raising her head from her pillow, and noticing,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span>
with a little anxiety, the unusual expression of
her attendant&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Phelim, my brother, miss, has been here,
and it&rsquo;s a house full o&rsquo; company there is at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And they want you to spend the holy Sabbath
to-morrow in visiting them, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Miss Annie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Lee, after a moment&rsquo;s
silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing to speak of, ma&rsquo;am. Leastways
nothing to trouble ye about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I can see that it is something that
troubles you, Norah,&rdquo; said Annie, taking the
rough hand of Annorah in hers, and drawing
her nearer. &ldquo;Is it something that you would
rather I should not know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed no. But it&rsquo;s loath I am to add my
bit troubles to yours, when ye suffer yer own so
patiently. It&rsquo;s only that all my relatives, and
the praste, and the Catholic neighbours, are
waiting for me to come home, to bring me back
to the ould Church by force. An&rsquo; Phelim, poor
boy, came to tell me to keep away. It&rsquo;s worse
he&rsquo;ll be for the damp air; and it&rsquo;s angry they&rsquo;ll
be for my staying away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! Annorah, my dear nurse, I was afraid
that rougher times awaited you. I was afraid
they would persecute you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg&nbsp;42]</a></span>
&ldquo;But they haven&rsquo;t yet, Miss Annie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is not what you would call persecution,
but it is sad to have those we love turn
against us. You must trust in God, my poor
girl. He will give you grace to bear it all.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>THE CONFESSIONAL&mdash;AN IRISH FROLIC.</h3>


<p>Great was the uproar in Biddy Dillon&rsquo;s cottage
when it was found that Annorah was not coming
to make her usual Saturday evening visit to her
mother.</p>

<p>Preparations had been made by Father M&lsquo;Clane
for holding a regular confessional; and an hour
before sunset, he had taken his seat in the little
darkened chamber, behind a table on which four
tallow-candles were burning, with an uncertain,
flickering light.</p>

<p>It had been decided in the council of relatives
and friends that Annorah&rsquo;s only chance of salvation
lay in speedy confession, and it was very
reasonably supposed, that could she be brought
back to that Popish duty, a great point would
be gained in the way to her perfect restoration.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, no affectionate, loving circle
that had now assembled to &ldquo;bear a hand&rdquo; in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg&nbsp;43]</a></span>
Annorah&rsquo;s restoration to the faith. One after
another went reverently on their knees up the
short, steep stairway, and came down lighter in
purse, and, as the priest wickedly taught them,
absolved of all offences, but swelling with wrath
against the poor girl whose coming was so long
delayed. And when, at last, it became apparent
that she would not come, a storm of abuse was
poured upon Biddy, who, it was evident to all,
did not cordially join in their violent measures.</p>

<p>Now, Biddy Dillon had too much of the national
character to sit down quietly and receive
their abuse, and soon a regular quarrel ensued,
which would have speedily become a fight, but
for the descent of Father M&lsquo;Clane into their
midst, and his imperative command that each one
should sit down quietly and &ldquo;hould his tongue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whisht! whisht! Of what are ye thinking,
ye silly gossoons? Will ye bring down the peace
officers upon ye, and take out the bit o&rsquo; the night
in the prison, instead o&rsquo; drinking me health, as
ye may, and me helping to do that same?
Arrah! Why should ye glower and snarl at
each other, like a kennel o&rsquo; mad puppies, when
it&rsquo;s the brave frolic ye may have together? It&rsquo;s
the soft looks and the fine words ye must use, an&rsquo;
ye would win the young heretic back; ye may
fight over her till the great day o&rsquo; all, and it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg&nbsp;44]</a></span>
will be but a sorrowful waste o&rsquo; the powther,
barrin&rsquo; the swate chance ye are losing now o&rsquo; a
comfortable frolic. Arrah, now, Dennis darlin&rsquo;,
a sup o&rsquo; the whisky for me, a thrifle sthrong, an&rsquo;
ye plaze. It&rsquo;s a could night to be out wi&rsquo; an
empty stoomach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay till the morning, father,&rdquo; said Biddy,
coming up to him with an anxious face; &ldquo;we
cannot kape peace an&rsquo; ye do not bide wi&rsquo; us; the
frolic will be all the better an&rsquo; ye stay to the
orderin&rsquo; o&rsquo; it,&mdash;and the best bed is waitin&rsquo; yer
riverence&rsquo;s convanience. There&rsquo;s Sandy and
Mike will fight an&rsquo; ye lave, and Katy there is
ready to tear out the eyes o&rsquo; big Nelly Murphy.
It&rsquo;s quarrelling they&rsquo;ve been the whole blessed
day. Bide with us, lest the dear childer who is
the cause o&rsquo; it all should be kilt and murdered
intirely, an&rsquo; she sthrays home to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She spoke in a low voice, and he replied in
the same tone, drawing her back from the crowd,
who were all talking together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Biddy Dillon,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the
girl must lave that grand house and come home
to live here with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lave Miss Annie, do ye mane, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Small hope for her sowl an&rsquo; she do not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And few are the pennies I can bring to yer
riverence when the child has no wages to bring
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg&nbsp;45]</a></span>
home o&rsquo; a Saturday. Sorra a hap&rsquo;orth to spare
will I find; it&rsquo;s no me two hands alone can find
bread for the mouths o&rsquo; all, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stuff and nonsense!&rdquo; interrupted the priest;
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s many another place can be had for a
sthrong, likely lass like her. Good servants are
not over plenty, and she can be better placed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where, I would like ye to tell? It&rsquo;s in
a Protestant family she must be, an&rsquo; she goes out
to service at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; but they&rsquo;ll let her alone in some
houses. Sorra a bit do the most o&rsquo; them care
what becomes o&rsquo; the sowl, an&rsquo; the work be done
to their liking. Our Lady be praised! it&rsquo;s to
the far counthrees that the Protestant missionaries
are sent, and the silver is given; for
one-half o&rsquo; the pains taken wi&rsquo; the poor crathurs
who work in their kitchens would have ruined
us all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yer riverence spakes thrue, to be shure,&rdquo;
said Biddy; &ldquo;but for all that, it will never be a
bit o&rsquo; use to thry to make a good Catholic o&rsquo;
Norah, now that she can read the big books and
talk so bravely herself. An&rsquo; it were to be the
savin&rsquo; o&rsquo; her life, she would never confess to a
praste again, or take the holy wafer from his
hands. But if ye would take it aisy and lave it
to me, and persuade these meddlesome boobies
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg&nbsp;46]</a></span>
to mind their own particular business, and throuble
us no more, it&rsquo;s meself would be sure to bring the
handsome sum to yer riverence when I come to
confession. Contrariwise, you see, and you kape
fussing, and they kape fussing, it&rsquo;s all loss it is
to ye, and no gain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The priest&rsquo;s countenance brightened perceptibly.
He seemed much impressed with Biddy&rsquo;s
view of the case, and was not slow to perceive its
worldly wisdom. So, after addressing the waiting
company to some purpose, he left them.</p>

<p>But Biddy sat thoughtfully in a corner, with
her lame boy. She had, in her conversation with
the priest, cunningly hit on an expedient to propitiate
him for a time, but she was ill at ease.
She could not at once throw off the chains of
teaching that had bound her all her life; and so
dim was the light that she had received, that she
dared not yet follow it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, then, it&rsquo;s a jewel she is, core o&rsquo; me heart,
Norah dear!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The last two words were whispered so loud
that Phelim heard them, and he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen
her to-night, mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who? Spake aisy, mavourneen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our Norah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo; questioned his mother, with an anxious
glance at the unheeding revellers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg&nbsp;47]</a></span>
&ldquo;Afther dusk. I thought ye would like her
to kape away to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now blessings on ye for a handy callant as ye
are,&rdquo; said Biddy, patting his shoulder approvingly.
&ldquo;An&rsquo; how is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well as ever, mother, and kind-tempered and
good too. A power of good things she has sent,
and they&rsquo;re safe hid in the cellar. The money is
in me coat pocket, mother. Shall I give it ye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not now. Kape it till all be gone. Was
she sorry or mad, Phelim?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mad? Not at all. Sorry? I don&rsquo;t know at
all. Her voice was all courage and kindness;
but I saw big tears on her cheek, for all that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mother and son sat silently looking into
the fire for a few moments. At last Phelim spoke.
&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;ye&rsquo;ll not have them
abuse her and torment her, just for changing into
such a dear crathur?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a heretic, lad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What o&rsquo; that? She&rsquo;s good, any way,&rdquo; said
Phelim stoutly. &ldquo;I would I were a big man.
We&rsquo;d see who would throuble her then. It&rsquo;s a
thrashin&rsquo; they&rsquo;d get, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s manners they&rsquo;d learn,
and no charges made for the teaching.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whisht, lad! it&rsquo;s careful and sly we must be.
An&rsquo; do ye not bother yer poor head wi&rsquo; yer
sister&rsquo;s new notions. It&rsquo;s a nation o&rsquo; throuble I&rsquo;d
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg&nbsp;48]</a></span>
have with a pair o&rsquo; ye at once; and ye&rsquo;re no
earning money, Phelim, boy, to buy off the
praste. Kape a still tongue, lad, an&rsquo; ye bite it
in two; an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t go for to meddle wi&rsquo; matters
concerning yer sowl. The praste an&rsquo; yer poor
mother will kape a sharp look-out; an&rsquo; it will go
hard, shure, if between us ye are not saved at last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, mother, where is the harm if I look for
meself a bit? Who can see Norah, so gentle
and loving, so careful o&rsquo; you and me, so pleasant
to every one, and not want to know more o&rsquo; the
way she has taken?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, lad; but have ye no sense at all?
What if ye have been tould a secret, can ye not
kape it the same? Now mind, once for all;
ye&rsquo;re not to know it at all, if Norah brings home
the Word o&rsquo; the Lord to read to her ould ignorant
mother (it&rsquo;s a swate voice she has), and ye shall
hear the big Book as well; only mind, Phelim,
acushla, ye&rsquo;re to know nothing at all, let who will
spake to ye o&rsquo; the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; but, mother, what if I myself learn
to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&mdash;Is it o&rsquo; me ye are spaking?&rdquo; asked
Biddy, turning to a cluster of people who had
drawn near them. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no hearty I feel to-night,
and poor lame Phelim is kaping me company.
Is it room for the dance ye are wanting?
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg&nbsp;49]</a></span>
The other is the roomiest, and the floor is the
plainest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hurrying out with ready good-will to assist
in the needful preparations, Biddy soon removed
any suspicions that might have been entertained
in the minds of any of her neighbours of any
leaning on her part toward heresy.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>BIDDY DILLON BECOMES A &ldquo;HERETIC.&rdquo;</h3>


<p>Several months passed quietly by. It was
winter, and the heaviest snow that had fallen
within the memory of that personage so universally
known and respected&mdash;namely, the oldest
inhabitant&mdash;now lay upon the ground; and all in
town and country who were partial to the exercise
of skating could enjoy it freely. But the
severe cold confined the delicate invalids to their
heated rooms, and fair Annie Lee again found
herself shut up to the tiresome routine of sick-room
pleasures, only varied by intervals of suffering.
The pleasure, however, predominated.
She seemed almost to forget her pain and increasing
languor in her unceasing efforts to
instruct her young nurse.</p>

<p>Annorah, on her part, thirsted for knowledge,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg&nbsp;50]</a></span>
especially for the wisdom that cometh from above.
She improved, too, rapidly enough to satisfy a
less partial teacher. In the varied arts of housewifery,
and in the more intricate use of the needle,
she had also become quite expert, and, to use
Mrs. Lee&rsquo;s own words, &ldquo;was quite a treasure in
every part of the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Little lame Phelim came for an hour each
afternoon to Miss Annie&rsquo;s room to be made a
&ldquo;schollard, shure;&rdquo; and every Saturday evening
found Annorah, with her Bible, seated by her
mother&rsquo;s fireside, reading, and in her own earnest
but uncouth manner expounding the truths she
read.</p>

<p>One Sabbath evening in March, Father M&lsquo;Clane
set out for a walk to Mrs. Dillon&rsquo;s cottage. His
prospects and reflections had been of a grave and
sad character throughout the day, and his threadbare
coat and lean purse had been more than
usually suggestive of the great truth, that all
earthly comforts are fleeting and transitory.</p>

<p>For the first time Biddy had that day absented
herself from the Catholic chapel. Annorah had
lately added to her Scripture reading, &ldquo;Kirwan&rsquo;s
Letters to Archbishop Hughes.&rdquo; She read it
to her mother whenever a spare hour enabled her
to run home. Biddy had been greatly interested
in the appeals and arguments of her talented
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg&nbsp;51]</a></span>
countryman, and deeply impressed by his life-like
delineation of the follies and superstitions of the
Romish ritual.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rasonable he is intirely,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and
a bright son o&rsquo; the ould counthree, blessin&rsquo;s on
it! It&rsquo;s him who spakes well o&rsquo; the poor ruined
crathers, and praises us all for the natural generous-sowled
people we are. He knows us intirely,
Norah dear. Shure he&rsquo;s a wonderful man and a
bould, let alone the thrue son o&rsquo; ould Ireland,
for doing the beautiful thing. Read us one more
letther, mavourneen, before ye are off, and lave
the book here. Mayhap Phelim will spell out a
morsel or so when the Sabbath even is coom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will not go to confession to-morrow,
dear mother?&rdquo; said Annorah.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; replied Biddy firmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It goes to my heart, mother, that the money
we earn so hardly, and which should be kept to
comfort your old age, should go for nothing, or
worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will do it no more. Make yer heart aisy,
honey. Never a penny o&rsquo; mine will the praste
hould in his hand again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will visit you, mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; what o&rsquo; that? Let him coom. He is
welcome an&rsquo; he minds his own business, and only
dhraps in for a bit o&rsquo; gossip; but an&rsquo; he interferes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg&nbsp;52]</a></span>
in me private consarns, it&rsquo;s soon he&rsquo;ll find himself
relaved o&rsquo; all throuble on account o&rsquo; us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Annorah saw that there was no reason now to
fear that her mother would be overawed by the
priest; but she still lingered anxiously. Her
mother saw the shade on her face, and asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Norah? Are you in throuble?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not quarrel with him, mother,&rdquo; replied
the daughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let him be dacent, and it&rsquo;s ceevil treatment
he&rsquo;ll get; but no man shall browbeat me on me
own floor,&rdquo; said Biddy, in a tone which declared
the firmness of her purpose.</p>

<p>It was on the night succeeding this conversation,
that Father M&lsquo;Clane visited the cottage.
As he approached the house he paused at the
unusual sound of a voice reading. It was Phelim
imperfectly spelling out to his mother and a few
of the neighbours one of the letters of Kirwan.
The priest, who was not remarkably well versed
in the books of the day, did not know the work,
but supposed that it was the Bible to which they
were so profoundly listening. His face grew as
dark as the night shades around him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve caught ye at last!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as,
without ceremony, he burst into the room.
&ldquo;This tells the story. It&rsquo;s not that ye are ill in
bed, or hindered by the rain, or the could; it&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg&nbsp;53]</a></span>
because ye are heretics all, that ye shun the confession
and the holy mass. Do ye know what
the Church has power to do wi&rsquo; the like o&rsquo; ye?
Arrah! it was the heavenly and not the mortal
wisdom that made the hot fires o&rsquo; purgatory for
such. Small help will ye get from me when the
flames are scorching ye. Never a mass shall be
said for a sowl o&rsquo; ye, unless ye repent at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what call have ye to spake the like o&rsquo;
that,&rdquo; said Biddy, &ldquo;and me sitting peaceably by
me own fire wi&rsquo; the neighbours?&rdquo; She spoke
in a low, uncertain tone, for his sudden appearance
had startled her. A hush had fallen on the
little assembly, and signs of terror flitted across
the faces of the most timid, as the familiar voice
of the priest recalled their old Popish fears. He
was not slow to perceive this, or to take advantage
of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who taught yer lame boy to read at all?
Who brought the heretic Bible into yer house?
And who gathered the poor neighbours together
to hear the false words that lead to perdition?
Answer me that, Misthress Dillon,&rdquo; said the
priest in a tone of anger.</p>

<p>Biddy did not reply, though she had quite regained
her usual courage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask ye a plain question, Biddy Dillon,
and I want a straight answer. Will ye, or will
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg&nbsp;54]</a></span>
ye not, give up these heretic doings, and stay in
the communion o&rsquo; the holy Church?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; it plaze yer riverence,&rdquo; replied Biddy,
no ways disconcerted, &ldquo;yer blessed saints are
nothing to me; an&rsquo; I shall do as I plaze.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear the woman! Do you hear the bould
blasphemer?&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; what if they do hear? It were a sore
pity they should be sthruck deaf to plaze ye,&rdquo;
replied Biddy, her eyes flashing with excitement.
&ldquo;I would ye were in ould Ireland, or, for the
matther o&rsquo; that, in purgatory itself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We would&mdash;&rdquo; said the priest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt o&rsquo; it. But it&rsquo;s here I am, at yer
service,&rdquo; interrupted Biddy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and it&rsquo;s here ye&rsquo;ve been bought for a
wee pinch o&rsquo; tae and a few poor, lean chickens.
Sowl and body ye&rsquo;ve been bought, and a mighty
poor bargain have the blind purchasers made
o&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Plazing yer riverence, ye know nought o&rsquo;
what ye are saying, and small throuble ye&rsquo;ll make
wi&rsquo; yer idle words. It&rsquo;s not a turkey, duck, or
hen could buy Biddy Dillon. Ye&rsquo;ve tried it
yerself, father, and so ye know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a black heart ye have,&rdquo; said the priest,
whose courage was hardly equal to his anger,
and whose valour speedily cooled before resolute
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg&nbsp;55]</a></span>
opposition. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s blacker than ink ye are, Biddy
Dillon, with the wicked heresy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Like most Irish women, Biddy was well
skilled in the art of scolding, and among her
neighbours was considered rather more expert in
the business than themselves. When angry,
abusive epithets seemed to fall as naturally from
her tongue as expressions of endearment when
she was pleased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A black heart, did ye say?&rdquo; she cried, rising
and facing the priest, who involuntarily retired a
step from her; &ldquo;the same to yerself! An&rsquo; ye
were bathed in Lough Ennel, and rinsed in the
Shannon at Athlone, it would not half clane out
the vile tricks ye are so perfect in. A black
heart has Biddy Dillon? An&rsquo; ye were ducked
and soaked over night in the Liffey mud at Dublin,
ye were claner than now? A black heart?
An&rsquo; yerself an ould penshioner, idle and mane,
stirrin&rsquo; up a scrimmage in an honest woman&rsquo;s
house, and repeating yer haythenish nonsense,
an&rsquo; ye able and sthrong to take hould o&rsquo; the
heaviest end o&rsquo; the work! Are ye not ashamed?
What are ye good for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The saints preserve us! what a tongue the
woman has!&rdquo; exclaimed Father M&lsquo;Clane, making
a futile effort to smile, as he turned his face,
now pale as death, toward the company. &ldquo;But
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg&nbsp;56]</a></span>
I have no time to stay longer. I warn ye all,
my friends, to kape away from this accursed
house, and to turn a deaf ear to all that is said
to ye here. Your souls are in peril. Ye are
almost caught in the snare. Ye should run for
yer lives before ye perish entirely. I shall remember
you, Biddy Dillon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In course ye will. An&rsquo; ye show yerself here
again, barrin&rsquo; as a peaceable frind or ould
acquaintance, ye&rsquo;ll find yerself remimbered too,
honey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a silence of some minutes after the
priest left the house. It was broken by the
most timid of the party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Afther all, Biddy, my heart misgives me.
Of what use are all the prayers on the beads, the
Hail Marys, and the penance, the fasting from
meat on Fridays, or even the blessed salt o&rsquo; our
baptism, if we anger the praste, and he refuse to
give us the holy oil at the last? What will become
o&rsquo; us then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can a wicked ould praste do to help
us? It&rsquo;s God alone can strengthen us then. I
wouldn&rsquo;t give a penny for the oil. It&rsquo;s a betther
way, darlin&rsquo;, that God has provided for us.
It&rsquo;s a brave story that Phelim is waiting to
read to us. There&rsquo;s thruth and sense in it, too,
ye will find.&mdash;It&rsquo;s a fine counthree is this, Masther
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg&nbsp;57]</a></span>
Barry, and a free,&rdquo; added Biddy, turning to a
stout man, who, with scarcely a whole article in
his apparel, was lounging in the shade of a
corner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thrue for ye,&rdquo; he replied,&mdash;&ldquo;though it&rsquo;s
little I get out of it, barrin&rsquo; the sup o&rsquo; whisky
wi&rsquo; my supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But ye might&mdash;the more shame it is. Ye
are weel-conditioned and hearty. It&rsquo;s no the
counthree is to blame, neighbour, nor Katy
indade. She works night and day for ye an&rsquo; the
childer. Ye are better here than over the sae.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, then, I don&rsquo;t know. When I came to
this counthree, I had never a rag to me back,
an&rsquo; now, faith, I&rsquo;m nothing but rags. A fine,
illigant counthree!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lave the liquor alone, Peter Barry, and ye
may have the best of the land for yerself. An&rsquo;
ye would give up the dhrinking, a better lad
could not be found, nor a handsomer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too sthrong for me. It&rsquo;s many a day
have I given it up for ever, and been drunk as a
beast in an hour. But to-night, says Katy to me,
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s the heretic Bible as is read at Mrs. Dillon&rsquo;s
has a cure in it for weak sinners like you, Peter
dear.&rsquo; So I came to hear a bit o&rsquo; the Bible, an&rsquo;
ye plaze.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Kirwan&rsquo;s Letters were laid aside, and a New
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg&nbsp;58]</a></span>
Testament brought out. Phelim read very
poorly, and was often obliged to spell over the
long words, and did not always succeed in giving
the correct pronunciation; but no fault was found
by his eager listeners. He read how Christ healed
the leper, and poor Peter Barry found in the
story a word of encouragement for him. He
read of the Saviour&rsquo;s gracious compassion for the
hungering multitude; and his ignorant auditors
praised the divine Being who so sympathized with
mortal infirmities. Phelim was often interrupted
by remarks or approving comments, but these in
no way diminished the interest of the sacred
story.</p>

<h3>ANNIE&rsquo;S DEATH&mdash;ANNORAH&rsquo;S PROSPECTS.</h3>


<p>On every pleasant evening Biddy Dillon&rsquo;s cottage
was thronged by those who came to listen to the
Word of God. It was in vain that Father M&lsquo;Clane
opposed these meetings. His threats and arguments,
once so potent, seemed now but to lessen
his power. He even secured the services of a
neighbouring priest, and with him visited each
Irish family in succession, coaxing and flattering
where his authority was not acknowledged.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg&nbsp;59]</a></span>
But, alas for him and his prospects! he could do
nothing with the people.</p>

<p>The Protestant clergyman of the village, when
he heard of the interest felt in lame Phelim&rsquo;s
reading, readily came to their assistance, and joyfully
read and explained the divine lessons. As
their knowledge of the right way increased, their
impressions of its importance to them personally
were deepened, and Annorah soon had the happiness
of seeing not only her mother and brother
bowing at the foot of the cross of Christ, but
many others earnestly seeking the salvation of
their souls.</p>

<p>The little Irish neighbourhood had been named
New Dublin. It stood quite by itself, a thick
belt of wood and the narrow mill-stream isolating
it from the large village, where Mr. Lee&rsquo;s
residence stood. Nothing but the smoke, which
in summer as well as in winter is ever pouring
from Irish chimneys, revealed to a visitor the
existence of their pleasant hamlet. Still it was
not so far retired but that, when a wake was held
for the dead, the noise of the revelry seriously
disturbed their quieter neighbours; and when a
row ensued, as was often the case, the distant uproar
alarmed as well as annoyed the timid women
and children. But no one thought of interfering.
The wealthy owners of the iron-works and factories
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg&nbsp;60]</a></span>
in the vicinity were glad to secure their labour,
because of its cheapness, and never troubled themselves
about an occasional noise, if the general
interests of their business were not neglected.</p>

<p>There were not wanting those who pitied their
low estate, and who would have sincerely rejoiced
in their elevation; but until poor invalid Annie
Lee began to instruct Annorah, no one had
dreamed of winning them, by self-sacrifice and
kindness, to a knowledge of the truth. Annie
herself, while patiently explaining over and over
again what seemed to her as simple and plain as
possible, little imagined the glorious results that
were indirectly to grow out of her feeble efforts.
But God watches the least attempt to do good,
and fosters the tiniest seed sown; and Annie,
without knowing it, was sowing seed for a plenteous
harvest.</p>

<p>But while the good work prospered, she herself
was rapidly ripening for heaven. She knew
that she was hastening to a better land, even a
heavenly; and she strove to improve every moment
of the time that remained, in efforts to give
stability to Annorah&rsquo;s religious feelings. Many
were the conversations that they had together on
the condition of the poor Irish people, and countless
almost were the directions that Annorah received
in regard to the best methods of winning
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg&nbsp;61]</a></span>
their love and confidence. Young as she was,
Annie had learned that all efforts to benefit the
unfortunate or ignorant are vain so long as the
cold shoulder is turned towards them. She had
proved in Annorah&rsquo;s case the magic effect of loving
words and sympathy.</p>

<p>As the spring advanced, Annie grew weaker.
The mild air seemed to enervate rather than to
brace her system, and she grew daily more
emaciated. Her paroxysms of pain were less
frequent, and she suffered most from languor and
drowsiness. It was apparent to all but her fond
parents that her days were numbered. They
watched over her with the tenderest affection,
hoping when there was no hope, and persuading
themselves and each other that she would rally
again when the ripe summer brought its gentle
breezes and beautiful blossoms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is so fond of flowers and of the open
air,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lee to Annorah, when, after an
unusually restless and painful day, Annie had
fallen asleep at last, and both left the room to
breathe the fresh evening air. &ldquo;When the weather
gets settled so that she can let you draw her little
carriage down by the mill-stream again, she will
brighten up and get stronger. It is enough to
make a well person ill, to be shut up so long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye know best, shure,&rdquo; said Annorah, in her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg&nbsp;62]</a></span>
grief resuming her national accent and brogue&mdash;&ldquo;Ye
know best, but it&rsquo;s thinner and weaker she&rsquo;s
getting, and is a baby for weight in me arms.
Och! the dark day it will be for poor Norah
when she looks her last on that swate angel face!&rdquo;
And the poor girl burst into tears, and covered
her face with her apron. After a few moments
she went on to say,&mdash;&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll go hard wi&rsquo; ye all,
Mrs. Lee: ye&rsquo;ll miss her dear ways an&rsquo; her
heavenly smiles; she is yer own blood, were she
not an angel intirely. But oh, ma&rsquo;am, she&rsquo;s been
to me what no words can tell; and the short life
o&rsquo; me will seem without end till I go to wait on
her above. Oh, what&rsquo;ll I do without her, when
the whole world is dark as night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee could not reply, for she, too, was
weeping. There was something in Annorah&rsquo;s
desolate tone that went to her heart, and inspired
a pitying affection for the plain-looking girl by
her side, which she would once have thought impossible.
She began to comprehend the mystery
of Annie&rsquo;s caressing manner to her young nurse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Annorah, my poor girl,&rdquo; she faltered at
length.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, ma&rsquo;am, in all me troubles, and when I was
wickedest, was it not her voice that was full and
sweet with the pleasant encouragement? Oh, core
o&rsquo; me heart, acushla, what&rsquo;ll I do? what&rsquo;ll I do?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg&nbsp;63]</a></span>
&ldquo;We must trust in God, Annorah. If he takes
her from us, it will be for the best, and we must
learn to say, &lsquo;His will be done.&rsquo; She will leave
us her lovely example to guide us, and we shall
not forget how she strove to do good. We shall
be lonely; but is it not selfish in us to wish her
to stay here and suffer? God knows what is best
for us all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was but a little time that they were permitted
to hope. Fair Annie Lee&rsquo;s appointed
work was done, her mission of love was accomplished,
and she was ready to depart. Shut up
by her protracted illness from all the ordinary
paths of usefulness, she had found out a way to
work in her Saviour&rsquo;s service. Long will it be
ere her gentle acts of kindness will be forgotten,
or her precious influence cease to be felt by those
who knew her.</p>

<p>She died suddenly, perhaps unconsciously at
last. Annorah had placed her couch so that she
could see the beautiful changes in the rich June
sunset; and when she returned after a moment&rsquo;s
absence to her side, she found that, with a sweet
smile of joyous triumph on her lips, she had fallen
asleep in Jesus.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>Annorah, although greatly refined by reading
and association with educated people, and especially
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg&nbsp;64]</a></span>
improved by the happy influence of true
religion, yet retains enough of the characteristics
of her nation to make her an acceptable visitor
in the humblest cottage in New Dublin. It was
long after the death of her young mistress before
she regained her usual cheerfulness. But time,
the great healer of sorrow, has gradually softened
her grief, and made her cherished memories of
Miss Annie, like beautiful pictures, very pleasant
to look upon.</p>
